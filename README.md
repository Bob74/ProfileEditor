# ProfileEditor

Profile Editor allows you to easily create or edit profiles for [No More Shortcuts](https://github.com/Bob74/NoMoreShortcuts).  
You will have a real time preview of what the phone contact or your menu will be in game.

It is quite self explanatory to use but if needed, you will find help by hovering the labels of every settings with your mouse cursor.
